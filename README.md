# Remove Netflix Subtitles

A wee Chrome Extension to hide any Netflix subtitles, regardless if Netflix's player shows the 'Off' button or not :)

# Motivation

I want to turn off subtitles to some films/shows on Netflix and it is not always possible.
So, I made it to solve my problem, and, I hope, someone else's as well.
